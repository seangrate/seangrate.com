          In 1996, L'vovsky showed the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the coordinate ring of a monomial curve is bounded by the sum of its semigroup's two largest gaps.
          We explore analogous results for toric surfaces embedded by incomplete linear systems, and show that for certain classes the regularity is controlled by the combinatorics of the associated semigroup, and is bounded by the area of the associated polygon.

          We study the Artinian reduction \( A \) of a configuration of a pointset \( X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n} \), and the relation of the geometry of \( X \) to Lefschetz properties of \( A \). 
          Migliore-Zanello initiated the study of this connection, with a particular focus on the Hilbert function of \( A \), and further work appears in Migliore-Miró-Roig–Nagel.
          Our specific focus is on betti tables rather than Hilbert functions, and we prove that certain betti tables force the failure of the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP); the corresponding Artinian algebras are typically not level, and the failure of WLP is not detected in terms of the Hilbert function.

          Modules and rings are central topics of study in advanced algebra; in the special case where the ring is a field, a module is just a vector space.
          One much studied class of rings are Artinian quotients of polynomial rings over a field \( k \); Artinian means the ring itself is a finite dimensional vector space over \( k \).
          I'll discuss two interesting properties of Artinian rings—the Lefschetz property (which is about the behavior of multiplication in the ring), and free resolutions, which come about from doing "linear algebra with matrices of polynomials".

              Despite online homework's growing prevalence as a uniform component in coordinated mathematics courses, few studies have considered the connection, or lack thereof, between instructors of record and fixed online homework sets.
              In this presentation we will share the results of a mixed-methods study examining how 10 university mathematics educators assessed the quality of a sampling of online Calculus I homework assignments.
              In the course of this project, we introduced our educators to a novel instrument called the Course Alignment Analysis Tool (CAAT), which leverages graph theory to assess the alignment between the learning outcomes that an instructor feels should be prioritized and the learning outcomes most emphasized by an assignment or assessment.
              In this highly interactive presentation, we will share both our results and walk you through using CAAT. For this reason, you have homework: Please bring a set of homework problems from an undergraduate course in your discipline!
              (If you're in the math department or happen to really enjoy calculus, we will have the Calculus I homework sets available for you to use).

              Tools from algebra and topology can be used to extract topological and geometric features of the data. 
              The essence of topological data analysis (TDA) is to use a filtration on a finite point cloud to construct an algebraic complex modeling the data. 
              The homology of this complex gives topological information about the data. 
              Summaries of the topological information are shown through barcodes and persistence diagrams. 
              This talk will give an overview of where TDA comes from, how it can be used, some examples, and potential research directions.

          A common theme among all these projects is the strong presence (and necessity) of computation.
          As such, there will be many examples written in Macaulay2 and Python to help understand where these projects came from and how they were completed.
