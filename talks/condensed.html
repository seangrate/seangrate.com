          We study the Artinian reduction \( A \) of a configuration of a pointset \( X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n} \), and the relation of the geometry of \( X \) to Lefschetz properties of \( A \). 
          Migliore-Zanello initiated the study of this connection, with a particular focus on the Hilbert function of \( A \), and further work appears in Migliore-Miró-Roig–Nagel.
          Our specific focus is on betti tables rather than Hilbert functions, and we prove that certain betti tables force the failure of the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP); the corresponding Artinian algebras are typically not level, and the failure of WLP is not detected in terms of the Hilbert function.

          Considered as an algebraic analog for the connected sum construction from topology, the connected sum construction introduced by Ananthnarayan, Avramov, and Moore is a method to produce Gorenstein rings. 
          Joint with Nasrin Altafi, Roberta Di Gennaro, Federico Galetto, Rosa M. Miró-Roig, Uwe Nagel, Alexandra Seceleanu, and Junzo Watanabe, we determine the graded Betti numbers for connected sums and fiber products of Artinian Gorenstein algebras, where the fiber product in the local setting was obtained by Geller. 
          We also show that the connected sum of doublings is the doubling of a fiber product ring. 
          I will discuss these results through some examples and Macaulay2 code.

          Modules and rings are central topics of study in advanced algebra; in the special case where the ring is a field, a module is just a vector space.
          One much studied class of rings are Artinian quotients of polynomial rings over a field \( k \); Artinian means the ring itself is a finite dimensional vector space over \( k \).
          I'll discuss two interesting properties of Artinian rings—the Lefschetz property (which is about the behavior of multiplication in the ring), and free resolutions, which come about from doing "linear algebra with matrices of polynomials".

              Considered as an algebraic analog for the connected sum construction from topology, the connected sum construction introduced by Ananthnarayan, Avramov, and Moore is a method to produce Gorenstein rings. 
              Joint with Nasrin Altafi, Roberta Di Gennaro, Federico Galetto, Rosa M. Miró-Roig, Uwe Nagel, Alexandra Seceleanu, and Junzo Watanabe, we determine the graded Betti numbers for connected sums and fiber products of Artinian Gorenstein algebras, where the fiber product in the local setting was obtained by Geller. 
              We also show that the connected sum of doublings is the doubling of a fiber product ring. 
              I will discuss these results through some examples and Macaulay2 code.

              For most rings, a lot of the data of the ring can be captured via its (minimal) free resolution.
              This can then be summarized with a Betti diagram which, in some sense, describes the complexity of the ring.
              If such a ring is also Artinian, the ring is said to have the weak Lefschetz property (WLP) if multiplication by some linear form is always full rank.
              Although Lefschetz properties are of interest to algebraists, many combinatorialists like to leverage constructions of Artinian algebras with the WLP to prove results about, for instance, log-concavity of sequences.
              Joint with Hal Schenck, we show that if the Betti table of an Artinian algebra has a certain substructure resembling a Koszul complex, then the Artinian algebra cannot have the WLP.

              Despite online homework's growing prevalence as a uniform component in coordinated mathematics courses, few studies have considered the connection, or lack thereof, between instructors of record and fixed online homework sets.
              In this presentation we will share the results of a mixed-methods study examining how 10 university mathematics educators assessed the quality of a sampling of online Calculus I homework assignments.
              In the course of this project, we introduced our educators to a novel instrument called the Course Alignment Analysis Tool (CAAT), which leverages graph theory to assess the alignment between the learning outcomes that an instructor feels should be prioritized and the learning outcomes most emphasized by an assignment or assessment.
              In this highly interactive presentation, we will share both our results and walk you through using CAAT. For this reason, you have homework: Please bring a set of homework problems from an undergraduate course in your discipline!
              (If you're in the math department or happen to really enjoy calculus, we will have the Calculus I homework sets available for you to use).

              The tropical semiring can be defined as the semiring over the extended real numbers where addition is defined by taking the maximum and multiplication is defined by classical addition. 
              In this setting, there is a nice interplay between algebra and polyhedral geometry.

              Tools from algebra and topology can be used to extract topological and geometric features of the data. 
              The essence of topological data analysis (TDA) is to use a filtration on a finite point cloud to construct an algebraic complex modeling the data. 
              The homology of this complex gives topological information about the data. 
              Summaries of the topological information are shown through barcodes and persistence diagrams. 
              This talk will give an overview of where TDA comes from, how it can be used, some examples, and potential research directions.

          Starting with Lefschetz properties, moving on to toric varieties and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and finishing with other miscellaneous projects, I will give an overview of the research I have conducted while at Auburn University.
          A common theme among all these projects is the strong presence (and necessity) of computation.
          As such, there will be many examples written in Macaulay2 and Python to help understand where these projects came from and how they were completed.
